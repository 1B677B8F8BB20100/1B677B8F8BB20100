### 'Sup

I am building a decentralized communication platform whose goal is to provide anonymity and protect freedom of speech:
- Take all the good parts of 4chan, BitTorrent, and I2P to fuse them together in a single application.
- Prefer practicality over generality (i.e. not try to reinvent the internet, but rather fulfill one purpose).
- Optimize for throughput and user experience while maintaining sound latency and security objectives.

Interested? Here is my [public key](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/1B677B8F8BB20100/1B677B8F8BB20100/master/public-key.txt) and the [development blog](https://1b677b8f8bb20100.github.io/).
