### 'Sup

I am building a decentralized communication platform whose purpose is to protect freedom of speech and expression:
- Take all the good parts of 4chan, BitTorrent, and I2P to fuse them together in a single application.
- Prefer practicality to purity (i.e. not try to reinvent the internet; rather do one thing, and do it well).
- Optimize for throughput and user experience while maintaining sound latency and security levels.

Interested? Here is my [public key](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/1B677B8F8BB20100/1B677B8F8BB20100/master/public-key.txt) and the [development blog](https://1b677b8f8bb20100.github.io/).
