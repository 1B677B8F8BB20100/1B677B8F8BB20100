### 'Sup

I am building a decentralized communication platform whose goal is to provide
anonymity and protect freedom of speech:
- Take all the good parts of 4chan, BitTorrent, and I2P to fuse them together.
- Prioritize practicality over generality (i.e. not try to reinvent the
  internet, just do one thing, and do it well).
- Optimize for throughput and user experience while maintaining a resonably low
  latency and a reasonably high security bar.
